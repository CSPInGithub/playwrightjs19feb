6. Workers control how many tests run in parallel. Since you have workers: 1, all tests execute sequentially in the same worker.
Contexts are independent browser sessions within the same worker.
When you create multiple browser contexts inside a test using browser.newContext(), each context behaves like a separate session (with its own cookies, storage, etc.).
Even though only one test is running, it can still open multiple independent browser sessions.
